<h2>VMware® Workspace ONE® Intelligence for Consumer Apps<a class="headerlink" href="#vmware-workspace-one-intelligence-for-consumer-apps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) provides the VMware Workspace ONE Intelligence for
Consumer Apps Software Development Kit (collectively the “Software”) to you
subject to the following terms and conditions. By downloading, installing, or
using the Software, you (the individual or legal entity) agree to be bound by
the terms of this license agreement (the “Agreement”).  If you disagree with
any of the following terms, then do not use the Software.</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>VMware Products:</strong> The Software contains a variety of materials, interface
definitions, documentation, sample utility applications and sample code
regarding programming interfaces to VMware’s Workspace ONE Intelligence for
Consumer Apps offering (the “Service”). This Software is intended to be used
to develop software that interacts with the Workspace ONE Intelligence
products.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Rights:</strong> Subject to the restrictions below, you may download and make
a reasonable number of copies of the Software for your use solely for the
purpose of creating software that communicates with the Workspace ONE
Intelligence products (the “Developer Software”), and integrating the
Software into your Developer Software to achieve interoperability with them.
Some portions of the Software may be customizable as more particularly set
forth in the Software documentation. You are permitted to re-distribute the
Software, including any authorized customizations, only as part of your
Developer Software for non-commercial or commercial use; provided that you
shall only distribute such code subject to a license agreement that protects
VMware’s and its licensors’ interests consistent with the terms contained in
this Agreement. Open source software components provided with the Software
are licensed to you under the terms of the applicable license agreements
included with such open source software components. The open source software
licenses can be found in the open_source_licenses.txt file, other materials
accompanying the Software, the documentation or corresponding source files
available at www.vmware.com/download/open_source.html.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> You agree that you will not (1) use the Software to
create, design or develop anything other than Developer Software; (2) make
any more copies of the Software than are reasonably necessary for the
authorized use and backup and archival purposes; (3) modify, create
derivative works of, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the
Software except as expressly permitted in Section 2; (4) distribute, sell,
lease, rent, lend, or sublicense any part of the Software to any third party
except as expressly permitted in Section 2; or (5) use the Software in any
manner to (a) circumvent any technical restrictions of the Service or
violate any additional licensing terms applicable to the Service that VMware
provides through product documentation, email notification on the VMware
website or in the Terms of Service or the End User License Agreements for
the Service or (b) upload or otherwise transmit any material containing
software viruses or other computer code, files or programs designed to
interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any software or hardware.</p>
<p>The restrictions in this Section 3 shall not apply if and to the extent they
contradict mandatory local law (including, but not limited to, law
implementing the EC Software Directive).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ownership:</strong> VMware retains ownership of the Software and all intellectual
property rights embodied in the Software, including without limitation all
copyrights, trade secrets and patents. You may not remove, delete or modify
any of VMware copyright statements in the Software. ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY
GRANTED HEREUNDER ARE RESERVED TO VMWARE.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trademarks:</strong> You may not use VMware’s name, trademarks or service marks
in connection with your Developer Software in a way that suggests your
Developer Software is certified or endorsed by VMware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback:</strong> You may from time to time provide suggestion, comments and
feedback to VMware concerning the functionality and performance of the
Software or the Service including, without limitation, identifying potential
errors and improvements (collectively the “Feedback”). Feedback which is
provided by you to VMware in connection with this Agreement may be freely
used by VMware to improve or enhance its products and, accordingly, you
grant VMware a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free,
worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sublicense, modify,
make, have made, distribute, sell, offer for sale, display, perform, create
derivative works, permit unmodified binary distribution and otherwise
exploit such Feedback without restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support:</strong> You are not entitled under this Agreement to receive any VMware
support or subscription services for the Software or any other services from
VMware in connection with the Software. If you have purchased support and/or
subscription services for a VMware product, such support and/or subscription
services shall not apply to the Software or your use of the Software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Term, Termination and Changes:</strong> This Agreement shall continue as long as
you are in compliance with the terms specified herein or until otherwise
terminated. You or VMware each may terminate this Agreement for any reason
at any time. You agree, upon termination, to destroy all copies of the
Software within your possession or control. The Restrictions, Confidential
Information, Limitations of Warranties and Liability, Ownership, Feedback,
Indemnification, Data Privacy, and General sections set out in this
Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confidential Information:</strong> “Confidential Information” means any
information disclosed by VMware to you pursuant to this Agreement that is
marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or in some similar manner and any
information which you knew or reasonably should have known to be
confidential. You shall treat as confidential all Confidential Information
of VMware and shall not use such Confidential Information except to exercise
your rights or perform your obligations under this Agreement. You will
protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or
disclosure in the same manner as you protect your own confidential or
proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable
care. You shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third
party during or after the term of this Agreement. This paragraph will not
apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) was rightfully in your
possession prior to receipt of such Confidential Information from VMware;
(b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of you; (c)
is rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality;
(d) is independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality
obligations; (e) is disclosed by you with VMware’s prior written approval;
or (f) you are required to disclose by applicable law or court order,
provided that you notify VMware of such required disclosure promptly in
writing and cooperate with VMware in any lawful action to contest or limit
the scope of such required disclosure. You acknowledge that breach of this
Section 9 will cause irreparable damage to VMware for which monetary damages
will be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, VMware will be entitled to seek
and obtain injunctive and any other relief (legal or equitable) to restrain
any breach or anticipated breach of this Section 9.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations of Warranties and Liability:</strong> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS
IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, VMWARE DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>

BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE OR YOUR
USE OF THE SOFTWARE, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN
CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.</p>
<p>VMWARE’S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED
HEREUNDER WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED US$100.00.</p>
<p>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF
ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Indemnification:</strong> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
VMware, and any of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates and
agents, from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities
and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), arising from
your customizations to the Software, the distribution or use of your
Developer Software by you or anyone else, and your breach of this
Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Export Control:</strong> You acknowledge that the Software is of United States
origin, is provided subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations,
may be subject to the export control laws of the applicable territory, and
that diversion contrary to applicable export control laws is prohibited.
You represent, warrant and covenant that (1) you are not, and are not
acting on behalf of, (a) any person who is a citizen, national, or resident
of, or who is controlled by the government of any country to which the
United States has prohibited export transactions; or (b) any person or
entity listed on the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated
Nationals and Blocked Persons, or the U.S. Commerce Department Denied
Persons List or Entity List; and (2) you will not permit the Software to be
used for any purposes prohibited by law, including, any prohibited
