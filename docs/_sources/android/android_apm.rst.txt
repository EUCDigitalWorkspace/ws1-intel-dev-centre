Network Insights
================

.. include:: ../shared/net_stats_include.txt

When Network Insights is enabled, the performance of HTTP traffic generated by
either ``java.net.HttpURLConnection`` or ``OkHttp`` will be monitored.
No action is needed in order to turn on Network Performance Monitoring.
Simply initialize Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK as normal.


Filtering Captured Data
-----------------------

By default, all URLs are stripped of query parameters before being sent to
Workspace ONE Intelligence. For example the URL
``www.yoururl.com/login?secret=foobar`` would be reported as
``www.yoururl.com/login``. It is also possible to add url blacklists to
completely prevent sensitive URLs from being sent to Workspace ONE Intelligence.
See :ref:`android_crittercism_config_apm` for further information.


Blacklisting URLs
-----------------

URL blacklisting can be used to prevent sensitive URLs from being captured by
the network instrumentation. Use
:ref:`CrittercismConfiguration.setURLBlacklistPatterns() <android_blacklist_urls>`
for configuring URLs that should not be monitored by Workspace ONE Intelligence
SDK. This configuration option must be set at initialization time of Workspace
ONE Intelligence.


Updating the Location
---------------------

Network Insights can tie location information to network data, if the application provides the location.
By default, location information is not obtained by Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK. 

You can update location information by using the
:ref:`Crittercism.updateLocation (Location) <network_update_location_android>`
method.
