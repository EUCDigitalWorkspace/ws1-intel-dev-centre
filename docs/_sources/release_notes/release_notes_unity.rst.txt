..   It should be rare that we use this section. 
..   Some examples:
..     * In iOS 4.1.0, our 64-bit SDK had crash reporting disabled crash reporting.
..     * Our iOS 5.1.2 SDK had a major bug that we went back and release
..       noted as a 'Known issue' after we found the bug.
.. **New**
..   Put stuff in this section if the line item doesn't fit in the other categories.
..   Some examples:
..     * Added a way to cancel transactions
..     * Handled exceptions are now recorded in breadcrumbs
..     * URL query parameters are now stripped by default
.. **Fixes**
..   This section is for calling out bugs that we fixed.

   :maxdepth: 2

Version 2.1.2 (Jun 5, 2017)
----------------------------

**New**

* Added App Load userflow for Android devices running Marshmallow and above.
* Updated the native Android SDK to 5.8.8. Please see :ref:`release_notes_android` for more details

Version 2.1.1 (Nov 30, 2016)
----------------------------

**New**

* Updated the native iOS SDK to version 5.6.4. Please see :ref:`release_notes_ios` for more details


Version 2.1.0 (Oct 25, 2016)
----------------------------

**New**

* Updated the native iOS SDK to version 5.6.3-rc.3. Please see :ref:`release_notes_ios` for more details
* Updated the native Android SDK to 5.8.2. Please see :ref:`release_notes_android` for more details

**Fixes**

* SDKs (Android and iOS) would previously send events generated while in opt out mode when the opt out flag was unset later. This event data is no longer sent.

Version 2.1.0-rc.1 (Oct 7, 2016)
---------------------------------

**New**

* Updated the native iOS SDK to version 5.6.3-rc.2
* Can now generate C# stack traces for unhandled exceptions in 'Fast but no Exceptions' mode


Version 2.0.0 (Apr 8, 2016)
-----------------------------

**New**

* Unified the CrittercismIOS and CrittercismAndroid classes into a common Crittercism class. The CrittercismIOS and CrittercismAndroid classes are still available, but we strongly recommend using the new Crittercism class as it works for both iOS and Android builds.
* Updated the native iOS SDK to version 5.5.6
* (iOS) Enabled asynchronous breadcrumbs by default

**Fixes**

* When compiling on Unity 4.x, a compile error would result because the ``Application.logMessageReceived`` API was not available in 4.x
* (Android) When compiling for Android with IL2CPP turned on, the iOS plugin would cause compile errors since it was not #ifdef'd properly.
* (iOS) App load transaction start time is now measured from the time the app icon is tapped.
* (iOS) Several symbols in PLCrashReporter were not properly being stripped from the SDK which resulted in several ‘duplicate symbol’ errors when compiling for IL2CPP on iOS.
* (iOS) The iOS plugin would hang during a crash when Script Call Optimizations was set to Fast but no Exceptions and IL2CPP was turned on.
