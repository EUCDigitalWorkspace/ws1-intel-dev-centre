* Google Maps SDK wasn't functioning properly when network monitoring was running.

-----------------------------

**New**

* Added new Apteligent framework for tvOS. We support the same features on tvOS as on iOS, except for monitoring Web View and Watch Connectivity.

Version 5.4.10 (Dec 17, 2015)
-----------------------------

**Fixes**

* ``NSURLSessionDelegates`` were being passed a reference to an
  ``NSURLSessionTask`` that was different than the one initially constructed.
  This impacts apps that have an ``NSURLSessionDelegate`` that performs a lookup
  using the ``NSURLSessionTask`` that it receives. This bug also causes the
  Nuke networking library to not load data properly.

Version 5.4.8 (Nov 24, 2015)

Version 5.4.6 (Nov 18, 2015)

* A bridging header is no longer required when using Crittercism with Swift.

**Fixes**

* Fixed a crash that was occurring in ``[CRBreadcrumbs flush]``. This crash was impacting devices running iOS 8.

----------------------------

**Fixes**

* Slow start-up times due to high number of breadcrumbs 
* Renamed a Crittercism variable from 'exceptionType' to 'crExceptionType' because it caused the Apple submission process to reject apps due to mistakenly identifying the variable as a non-public method.

Version 5.0.4 (Oct 9, 2014)
----------------------------

**New**

.. replaced 'userflows_ios' and others with versions suffixed with '_ws1' because the crittercism header docs were removed.  If we support them for legacy, then we may need to change these back.

Version 4.3.2 (Mar 13, 2014)
----------------------------

* Fix: Crittercism library causing ``AFNetworking`` to crash in ``[AFURLConnectionOperation connection:didSendBodyData:totalBytesWritten:]``.

* Fix: Synchronization issue in ``[Crittercism logHandledException:]`` that caused a crash in ``cr_get_battery_life``.

* Fix: Logging a nil breadcrumb would result in crashes not being logged to server.

Version 4.3.1 (Dec 18, 2013)
----------------------------

* Fix: Workaround for apps experiencing ``UIWebViews`` failing to load data on first launch when running on iOS 7. This only occurs in apps that subclass UIWebView, and Crittercism has filed a bug report with Apple. Note - Be aware that while your application may not directly subclass UIWebView, this is done in many common 3rd party libraries such as the Google AdMob and Millenial Media SDKs.

* Network Insights ignores requests that use the data: URI scheme.

* Fix: Removes ``JSONKit`` library (fixes rare crash that could occur very early during app startup while initializing ``JSONKit``).

* Enabling Crittercism while running on iOS < 5.0+ will log and do nothing further.


Version 4.3.0 (Nov 6, 2013)
---------------------------

* Instruments HTTP traffic created by ``NSURLConnection`` or ``ASIHTTPRequest`` on iOS 5.0+.

* Increases max stored offline crashes from 5 to 10 (default is still 3).

* Async breadcrumb mode performs all writes on a background thread. Previous behavior batched multiple breadcrumbs but still performed up to one write per iteration of the main run loop.

Version 3.5.6 (May 28, 2013)
----------------------------

* Fix: App load count was not being reset properly on upgrades, which could cause the user to be asked to rate too early after an upgrade.

Version 3.5.5 (May 25, 2013)
----------------------------

* Fix: Corner case when user should be reminded to rate again but they don't have internet access.

Version 3.5.4 (May 24, 2013)
----------------------------

* Add ability to configure "remind me later" count.

* App foregrounds count towards the "Rate me after __ loads" count.

* "Rate me" settings (has the user rated? did they click remind me later?) and counts are reset when a new bundle version of the app is detected, i.e. when the user upgrades their app.

Version 3.5.3 (May 17, 2013)
----------------------------

* Fix: Don't show extra rate me dialog if app backgrounded when already visible.

----------------------------

* Added async mode for breadcrumb writing.

* Removed delegate method that no longer applies since support forums were removed in v3.4.

* Dropped docs from the package. The online documentation is the canonical reference.


Version 3.4.5 (Nov 6, 2012)
---------------------------

* Internal cleanup.

Version 3.4.0 (Oct 18, 2012)
----------------------------

* Support forums have been dropped from the library.

* ``init`` "initializer" methods have been deprecated in favor of ``enable`` methods.

For example, you should call:

``[Crittercism enableWithAppId:@"YOURAPPIDHERE"]``

instead of

``[Crittercism initWithAppId:@"YOURAPPIDHERE"]``

This change was made to reflect the fact that the init methods were not
actually init methods in the way most Objective-C developers would think of
them. Calling the old methods will continue to work, but will issue warnings
during your build. Reduce the number of headers we distribute. ``Crittercism.h`` is all you need.

* Eliminate potential conflict with ``JSONKit`` headers for users of that library.

* Improved support for delayed initialization of Crittercism.


Version 3.3.4 (Sep 20, 2012)
