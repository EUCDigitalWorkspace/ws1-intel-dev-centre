..   It should be rare that we use this section. 
..   Some examples:

..     * Our iOS 5.1.2 SDK had a major bug that we went back and release
..       noted as a 'Known issue' after we found the bug.
.. **New**
..   Put stuff in this section if the line item doesn't fit in the other categories.
..   Some examples:
..     * Added a way to cancel transactions
..     * Handled exceptions are now recorded in breadcrumbs
..     * URL query parameters are now stripped by default
.. **Fixes**
..   This section is for calling out bugs that we fixed.

API Release Notes
======================

------------------------

Version 2 (Sept 28, 2016)
--------------------------

* API v2 endpoints now use a new pattern: Parts of the endpoint that remain
    constant, such as /crash or /trends, appear at the beginning of the URL, and
    parts that can change, such as app ID or crash hash, appear at the end, in
    ascending order of specificity. So, for example,
    https://developers.crittercism.com/v2/APP ID/trends/dau is now
    https://developers.crittercism.com/v2/trends/dau/APP ID
    This change only applies to v2 endpoints. Please see the docs for more details.
