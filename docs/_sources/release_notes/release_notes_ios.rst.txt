.. GUIDELINES:
.. Release notes should be formatted into sections in the following order (not all sections need to be filled out)
.. ..note:: Super important information goes in an orange note - stuff like "Xcode 7 is required"
.. **Known issues**
..   List things that we know are broken that used to work.
..   It should be rare that we use this section. 
..   Some examples:

..     * Our iOS 5.1.2 SDK had a major bug that we went back and release
..       noted as a 'Known issue' after we found the bug.
.. **New**
..   Put stuff in this section if the line item doesn't fit in the other categories.
..   Some examples:
..     * Added a way to cancel transactions
..     * Handled exceptions are now recorded in breadcrumbs
..     * URL query parameters are now stripped by default
.. **Fixes**
..   This section is for calling out bugs that we fixed.
