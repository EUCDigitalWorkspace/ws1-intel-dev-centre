Slack Integration Guide
-----------------------

**Slack** is a cloud-based team collaboration tool. Configure Apteligent Webhooks to automatically send messages to a Slack channel. The Webhook is triggered by a specific alert; for example, an increase in crashes or latency.

#. First, configure your Slack channel to accept incoming Webhook integrations. You'll get a Webhook URL that looks like this: ::

    https://hooks.slack.com/services/S018ED53L/A1M62T7KL/PR0qkyXM3GYkREifOobHZFVG


#. Run through the testing instructions given by Slack for your incoming Webhook. Once you've tested successfully, go to the Workspace ONE Intelligence platform.


#. In the Workspace ONE Intelligence platform, go to **Alerts** and click on **Alert Integrations**. Select **Webhook** and enter the URL given to you by Slack, replacing the 'https' prefix with 'slack'. (Don't worry - all traffic sent by Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK will still be sent over https). Add the channel name like this: ::

    slack://hooks.slack.com/services/S018ED53L/A1M62T7KL/PR0qkyXM3GYkREifOobHZFVG?channel=<CHANNEL_NAME>


It will look like this in the Portal:

**Note**: You may optionally configure the sender's username and the emoji shown by the Slack client by adding some more parameters, like this (replace '<YOUR_USERNAME>' and '<ICON_TO_USE>' with the username and icon you want to use): ::

    slack://hooks.slack.com/services/S018ED53L/A1M62T7KL/PR0qkyXM3GYkREifOobHZFVG?channel=<CHANNEL_NAME>&username=<YOUR_USERNAME>&icon_emoji=<ICON_TO_USE>

You can see the list of supported Slack emoji icons `here <http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/>`_. Just remember to strip off the : characters when you specify an emoji to the Workspace ONE Intelligence Webhook integration.
