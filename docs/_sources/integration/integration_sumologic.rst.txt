Sumo Logic Integration Guide
----------------------------

This topic describes how to integrate Apteligent alerts with
`Sumo Logic <http://sumologic.com>`_.
Sumo Logic is a cloud-based log management and analytics service that leverages
Big Data to deliver real-time IT insights.

Using Apteligent's Sumo Logic integration, all Apteligent alerts can be
delivered directly to your enterprise's existing Sumo Logic instance.

1. Login to Apteligent, go to **Alert Center** and **Alert Integrations**,
   and click **Add Integration**.

2. Select **Sumo Logic** as the Integration type and give your integration a **Name**.

3. Find your Sumo Logic **Source URL** by logging into Sumo Logic and selecting
   **Manage > Collectors**. In the Collectors page, click **Add Source** and select **HTTP**.

   When the URL associated with the Source is displayed, copy the URL. For more
   information, go to the `Sumo Logic Documentation <https://service.sumologic.com/ui/help/Default.htm#Configuring_an_HTTP_Source.htm>`_.

4. Paste the URL from the previous step. Click **Create Integration**.

6. If your Sumo Logic integration is working correctly, every time your
   Apteligent alert is triggered, it will be sent to Sumo Logic.
