Loggly Integration Guide
------------------------

This topic describes how to integrate Apteligent alerts with
`Loggly <http://loggly.com>`_.
Loggly is a cloud-based log management service that helps DevOps and technical
teams make sense of the the massive quantity of logs that are being produced by
a growing number of cloud-centric applications.

Using Apteligent's Loggly integration, all Apteligent alerts can be
delivered directly to your enterprise's existing Loggly instance.

1. Login to Apteligent, go to **Alert Center** and **Alert Integrations**,
   and click **Add Integration**.

2. Select **Webhook** as the Integration type and give your integration a **Name**.

3. Find your Loggly **Source URL** by logging into Loggly and selecting
   **Source Setup > Client Side Apps > HTTP/S Endpoint**.

   For more information, refer to the `Loggly HTTP Endpoint Documentation <https://www.loggly.com/docs/http-endpoint/>`_.

4. Paste the URL from the previous step. Click **Create Integration**.

5. Create a **New Alert** to test out your integration.

6. If your Loggly integration is working correctly, every time your
   Apteligent alert is triggered, it will be sent to Loggly.
