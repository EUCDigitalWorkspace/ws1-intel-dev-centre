Splunk Integration Guide
------------------------

This topic describes how to integrate Apteligent performance data with
`Splunk Enterprise <http://splunk.com>`_.
Splunk Enterprise is an on-premise log management and operational analytics service.

Using the Apteligent app for Splunkbase, Apteligent performance data,
such as crash reports, breadcrumbs, Network Insights summaries, and others,
can be automatically indexed in Splunk.

Below is an installation guide for using the Apteligent app.

1. From the Splunk interface, go to **Find More Apps** which brings up the
   Splunkbase App Store. The Splunk App Store is a directory of apps that can
   be installed with one click.

2. Search for the Apteligent app. Click on **Install free**.

3. Restart Splunk.
