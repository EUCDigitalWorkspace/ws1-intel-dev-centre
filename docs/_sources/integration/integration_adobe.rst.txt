Adobe Data Connector
####################

Activate the Workspace ONE Intelligence Data Connector in Adobe:

1. Login to your Adobe Analytics Account and navigate to the Data Connector.
 
2. In the Data Connector screen, click on "Add Integration" and sort the list of
   integrations by Name. From the list, drag and drop the Workspace ONE
   Intelligence widget to the Adobe Marketing Cloud.  

3. You will see an integration wizard popup with instructions and the
   Terms & Conditions. Check the box to accept and click "Create and Configure
   This Integration."

4. Choose the report suite where you want to integrate Workspace ONE
   Intelligence data. Each app integrated with Workspace ONE Intelligence will
   require its own integration to be activated in Adobe Analytics. You may
   activate a Data Connector in your Android app and iOS app report suite each
   (recommended), or you can activate multiple Data Connectors for each app in
   your Global Report Suite. 

5. Choose a name to the integration so that you can remember which report suite
   and Workspace ONE Intelligence app you are integration.

6. For Workspace ONE Intelligence to send correct data to your selected report
   suite, you need to provide the Workspace ONE Intelligence App ID and
   Workspace ONE Intelligence OAuth Token which you retrieved earlier.

7. That’s it! Review the values that you have entered and hit “Activate”.
   This integration will create the classifications and calculated metrics
   required for this integration automatically. To complete the integration,
   click on "Activate."
