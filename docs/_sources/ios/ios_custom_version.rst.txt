Customizing the App Version Reported to Workspace ONE Intelligence Platform
===========================================================================

Workspace ONE Intelligence Platform automatically groups all app performance data by app
version.  This allows monitoring for performance improvements and regressions
each time a new app version is released.

By default, the Apple SDK reports the version as a combination of
``CFBundleShortVersionString`` and ``CFBundleVersion`` found in the app's
Info.plist file.  If the ``CFBundleShortVersionString`` is not set, then only
the ``CFBundleVersion`` will be reported.  Typically both of these properties
are set, and the version reported will look something like "2.0.1 (534)" (for
example).

The default version that is reported is sufficient in most scenarios, but
sometimes it is desirable to customize the app version that is reported to
Workspace ONE Intelligence.  A custom version may be specified by adding an
additional property, ``CRAlternateVersion`` of type *String* to the app's
Info.plist file.
