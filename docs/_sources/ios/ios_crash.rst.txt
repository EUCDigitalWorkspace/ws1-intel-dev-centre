Logging Crashes
===============

Once Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK is initialized within your app, crashes will
automatically be captured and reported to the Workspace ONE Intelligence
platform. 

Testing Crash Reporting
-----------------------

When testing crash reporting, be sure to disconnect the Xcode debugger. The
debugger will hit a breakpoint before a crash actually occurs, which prevents
Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK from detecting a crash. To detach the debugger,
you can go to the '"Debug" menu in Xcode and click "Detach" while the app is
running.
Alternatively, you can click the "stop" button in the upper left hand corner of
Xcode. Next, go to your device or simulator, and open the app manually. Now you
should be able to test crash reporting without Xcode interfering.

Handling Offline Crashes
------------------------

If a user's device does not have Internet connectivity, Workspace ONE
Intelligence SDK caches any crashes that have occurred on the device until they
can be sent to Workspace ONE Intelligence. By default, Workspace ONE
Intelligence SDK caches up to three crashes on the device.  If more than the
maximum number of crashes occur, the oldest crash will be overwritten.
