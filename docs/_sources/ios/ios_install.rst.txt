Installing Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK for iOS
-------------------------------------------------

.. todo Add detail and screen shots to steps 2 and 3 below.

.. note::

   Cocoapods is no longer supported as a means of installing Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK. Please use Swift Package Manager as described below.


There are two ways you can add the Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK for Apple to your
project:

* **Swift Package Manager (SPM) (recommended)**
   Add the Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK package from this URL: <SPM.developer.vmware.com>
   TODO: add package URL
   
* **Manual**

    #. :ref:`Download <downloads>` and unzip the iOS SDK. Copy the resulting folder in your source folder.

    #. Drag the ``WS1Intelligence.xcframework`` into your XCode project. The iOS framework is in the ``iOS`` folder.

    #. Go to your XCode project: click on Build Phases and under "Link Binary with Libraries" add (‘+’) ``SystemConfiguration.framework`` and ``CoreData.framework``.

.. _initialize_ios:

Basic Setup
-----------

Obtain your app ID from Workspace ONE Intelligence platform.

1. **Import the Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK header**.

For Objective-C apps, import the Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK header in your
application delegate's implementation file.  For Swift applications, place this
import in your ``bridging-header.h`` file.

.. code-block:: objective-c

   #import <WS1Intelligence/WS1Intelligence.h>

2. **Enable Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK**.

Call ``enableWithAppID`` in your AppDelegate's ``application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`` method.

Objective-C

.. code-block:: objective-c

  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [WS1Intelligence enableWithAppID:@"YOUR APP ID GOES HERE"];
    // other code for your app
    return YES;
  }

Swift

.. code-block:: swift

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    WS1Intelligence.enable(withAppID: "YOUR APP ID GOES HERE")
    // other code for your app
    return true
  }

Register your app at the Workspace ONE Intelligence portal to get an App ID
to be used in place of ``"YOUR APP ID GOES HERE"``.

.. _setup_dsym_upload:

3. **Setup Automatic dSYM Uploads**.

.. include:: ./ios_upload_dsym_include.txt

Your app is now integrated with Workspace ONE Intelligence!  Additional features require adding more code to your project.


Interoperability with other SDKs
--------------------------------

Recommended initialization orders:


Crashlytics:

 Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK should be initialized before Crashlytics

Objective-C

.. code-block:: objective-c

    [WS1Intelligence enableWithAppID:@"YOUR APP ID GOES HERE"];

    // Initialize Crashlytics

Swift

.. code-block:: swift

    WS1Intelligence.enable(withAppID: "YOUR APP ID GOES HERE")

    // Initialize Crashlytics

AppDynamics:

 AppDynamics should be initialized before Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK

Objective-C

.. code-block:: objective-c

    // Initialize AppDynamics

    [WS1Intelligence enableWithAppID:@"YOUR APP ID GOES HERE"];

Swift

.. code-block:: swift


    // Initialize Crashlytics

    WS1Intelligence.enable(withAppID: "YOUR APP ID GOES HERE")

New Relic:

 Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK should be initialized before New Relic

Objective-C

.. code-block:: objective-c

    [WS1Intelligence enableWithAppID:@"YOUR APP ID GOES HERE"];

    // Initialize New Relic

Swift

.. code-block:: swift

    WS1Intelligence.enable(withAppID: "YOUR APP ID GOES HERE")

    // Initialize New Relic
